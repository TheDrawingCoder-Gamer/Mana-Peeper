# Mana Visualizer

We all know and love Botania, right? The very famous magi- *checks notes* tech mod. However I'm sure you've wondered before "how much mana do I need?" just to look at your pool and compare it with the recipe just for that to give you no explanation. Or maybe you're working on a modpack and would like to compare your numbers with existing recipe numbers without having to open up the recipe jsons (that was me). I have just the solution for you! Mana Visualizer lets you now see numbers for your mana pools, mana storing items, and mana consuming recipes (EMI only, use EMI, it's good, trust).

- Keep the formatting as-is and any new code added should follow the conventions and formatting
- Reach out to me on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/vNaqDzSNaB) server (#coding-stuff channel preferably) so we can collaborate easier on the changes
